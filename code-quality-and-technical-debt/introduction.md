# 6.1  Introduction

A Code Quality Review is a task with the goal of identifying types of weaknesses that exist within a given code base. The task involves both manual and automated review of the underlying source code and identifies specific issues that may be representative of broader classes of weakness inherent in the code. For Milestone 5, we have performed an automated code review of the project “Teammates” using FindBugs code review tool. A Code Review does not attempt to identify every issue in the code but instead attempts to identify types of risk within the code such that mitigation strategies can be devised. It should be noted that while the review process will be as thorough as possible in finding and reporting code weaknesses, it is not guaranteed to always find every possible weakness. If no issues are found, the review does not implicitly certify that the application is 100-percent “hack proof.” A Code Review is a strong part of an overall risk mitigation program to improve the quality of the application.
