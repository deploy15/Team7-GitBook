# Code Vulnerability Warnings

•          With respect to data security considerations, some malicious code vulnerability issues were detected. Though they are not many, circumventing them may not be a good decision in the long run.

•          There are 3 places in the code where the internal object representations are exposed. If some untrusted code accesses these instances and introduced unchecked changes to the mutable object would lead to the compromised security or other important properties.

•          The findings are documented in the Find Bugs report.

Although we discussed the top three results of the code review, there are several other findings which were uncovered. Bad coding practice was one of them which the FindBugs reported and most of them deal with performing string operations. The reason behind this is the differences in the use of methods in several Java versions. The second type of warning was Correctness warning which reported certain scenarios in the code that returned unwritten variables and passing null parameters to a non-null method parameter. The final one was the performance warning. There are a few fields in the code which are declared and initialized but never used anywhere. Such occurrences are advised to be removed from all the classes.
