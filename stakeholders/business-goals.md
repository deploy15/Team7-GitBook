# 2.2  Business Goals

TEAMMATES is a peer feedback/evaluation tool for student teams while allowing the instructor the ability to oversee and share his/her own comments. It aims to provide a powerful, simplistic, and flexible experience. It has the following business goals

1.         A custom communication portal for university teachers and students that tailors specifically to their needs and desires.

Teammates wants to get more user experiences from both teachers and students and make adjustments to the feedback. This will help make a better product and increase our user base.

2.         Enhances smooth partnerships among the invaluable contributors.

Giving contributors recognition has been and will remain a business goal for Teammates. \* Maintaining contributor relations and gaining more contributors is a goal of Teammates.

3.         Front-end and back-end Migration

TeamMates wishes to make front-end and back-end development as independent as possible. This includes migrating to Angular 7 as the front end framework and changing the middleware architecture from SSR-based to AJAX call back-end. This has a reference [here ](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/projects)

4.         A web service which is aesthetically appealing by adopting  a much more maintainable front-end development practice as referenced [here](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/projects)

5.         A product which although open source is secure and trustworthy.

There is ongoing discussion regarding security implications of OSS vs CSS particularly with web applications containing personal information as referenced [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/whitepaper_turnin/oss%2810%29.pdf). TeamMates wishes to ensure users that they have made organizational commitment to make TeamMates a leader in OSS security as referenced [here](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/wiki/Data-Protection). TeamMates will also be transparent in its security practices and concerns.
