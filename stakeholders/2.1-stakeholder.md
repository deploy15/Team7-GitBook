| **Stake Holder** | **Actor\(s\)** | **Interest in the Architecture** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acquirer** | Developers, End-users | Oversee the procurement of the Teammates product. As Teammates is open source software anyone can download the source code from the github repository. The Teammates website does have terms of use agreement that Teammates is to be used at your own discretion and risk and you will be solely responsible for any damages that may arise from such use. As they are protected under the GNU General Public License 2.0, any distributed works must be made available under the same license |
| **Analyst** | System/Product/Business Analyst | Responsible for analyzing the architecture to make sure it meets certain critical quality attribute requirements. Simplicity, Performance, and Flexibility Quality Attributes. |
| **Architect** | Software Architect | It is the responsibility of this stackholder to ensure that elicitated requirements from the other stackholders are well designed and documented. The products produced by this stackholder provides a means of reasoning about the system functionalities |
| **Communicator** | Project Mentor | Responsible for assuring performance to standards and processes to provide confidence in a productâ€™s suitability. |
| **Business Manager** | Project Lead | Although TeamMates is a not for profit business it still needs funding and has business operations costs. The person in charge of dealing with finances would be interested in the architecture to estimate the cost of new development costs in regards to developers, hardware needs and other aspects of the software development life cycle |
| **DevOps/Deployment** | DevOps Manager, DevOps Engineer, Conformance Checkers, Project Mentor | These stakeholders include analyzers and conformance checkers and they are interested in the architecture to ensure developers are developing the software in the way the architecture intended. In a project as big as TeamMates conformance by developers will likely be an issue. These type of stakeholders also involve deployment managers. Deployer is interested in the architecture because build systems, configurations, frameworks and hardware requirements, etc needed to deploy the system are often decided upon with direct correlation with the architecture. Being a web application, deployment is going to be an ongoing task and will likely need to adapt to changes in the software architecture. |
| **Database Administrator** | Database architect, Database Designer, Database Administrator | Most of the software components rely on database for communicating with each other. The architecture uses Google Cloud Datastore. He/She makes sure that the architecture of the software is well designed and optimised for effective communication among several software components. |
| **Designer** | Frontend Developer, UI/UX Engineer | The team of designers build a frontend wireframe architecture and try to make the User Interface as intuitive and user friendly as possible. The frontend and backend of the software architecture go hand in hand, in order to build a useful and smart user interface, it is important for these stakeholders to understand most of the software architecture. |
| **Developers** | Software Engineers, Software Developers | These stakeholders write the code to implement the results solution requirements |
| **Project Manager** | Project Manager/Project Mentor/Project Lead | Project manager manages and plans the execution of the project, build comprehensive plans and make sure the project aligns to the business goals |
| **Supplier** | Google Cloud Platform | Teammates architecture is largely built upon Google Cloud Infrastructure. Therefore, the infrastructure supplier for the architecture for Teammates is Google Cloud Platform |
| **Tester** | Software Tester | Anyone can write tests for Teammates. They have hundreds of TODO tasks and issues. If testers know the architecture, they will be able to write more tests and better tests. This will detect more bugs and improve the overall performance |
| **User** | Instructors, Students | Some users may be interested in the architecture because they have there own ideas of ways to improve Teammates. The users are the teachers and students. They know best what they want Teammates to be. Knowing the architecture will allow them to better describe their ideas in a software development context |
