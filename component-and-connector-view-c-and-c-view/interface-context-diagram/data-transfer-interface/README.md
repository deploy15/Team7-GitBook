# Data Transfer Interface



Data Transfer interface is another important interface used by Teammates storage module that can impact extensibility. This interface helps in creating the data transfer objects that are used for querying the data in GAE using Objectify. These data transfer objects are called as Data Attributes. There are a lot of elements interacting through this interface and for the Element interface specifications, we consider an example of CourseAttributes element.
