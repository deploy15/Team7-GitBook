# Business Goals

TEAMMATES is a peer feedback/evaluation tool for student teams while allowing the instructor the ability to oversee and share his/her own comments. It aims to provide a powerful, simplistic, and flexible experience. It has the following business goals

1.         A custom communication portal for university teachers and students that tailors specifically to their needs and desires.

TeamMates wants to get more user experiences from both teachers and students and make adjustments to the feedback. This will help make a better product and increase our user base.

2.         Enhances smooth partnerships among the invaluable contributors.

Giving contributors recognition has been and will remain a business goal for TeamMates. \* Maintaining contributor relations and gaining more contributors is a goal of TeamMates.

3.         Creating a webservice with an emphasis on usability.

Usability is perhaps the most vital non-functional attribute for TeamMates. Teachers and students are busy people and supplying a fast and easily understood service is vital to improve peer to peer advertising and user adoption. Creating user surveys to test usability levels and getting improvements is a major goal for TeamMates at this stage of development.

4.         A webservice which is aesthetically appealing.

The feelings and emotions users experience when using a web application is very important to a web application service in acquiring users and maintaining users. \[13\] Improving the overall feelings and visual appeal of the front end UI is a major business goal for TeamMates going forward.

5.         A product which although open source is secure and trustworthy.

There is ongoing discussion regarding security implications of OSS vs CSS particularly with web applications containing personal information. \[14\] TeamMates wishes to ensure users that they have made organizational commitment to make TeamMates a leader in OSS security. TeamMates will also be transparent in its security practices and concerns. \[15\]

6.         Front end should be modifiable and easy for outside developers to commit updates.

To get front end developers to work on TeamMates the environment should be easy to set up and instructions should be well documented. It is a goal of TeamMates to get more front end commits at this stage of development.

7.         Front-end and back-end Migration

TeamMates wishes to make front-end and back-end development as independent as possible. This includes migrating to Angular 7 as the front end framework and changing the middleware architecture from SSR-based to AJAX call back-end. \[16\]
