| **Storage** This module contains all the storage logic including the workflow, internal API’s used for communication, interaction with internal search engine, and interaction with Google Cloud Datastore database. |
| :--- |
| **Common** This package contains the common utility classes that are used by the storage module. It also contains the data transfer logic acting as a API between frontend and backend communication and exception handling logic. |
| **Data Transfer** This module contains the data transfer logic between the frontend and the storage module. |
| **Util** This package contains the utility classes used by the storage module such as data structure for storing array of objects like ArrayLists. |
| **Exception** This package is the exception handling module. It contains the logic of handling all the run time exceptions without halting the workflow of storage module. |
| **Entity** Entity module represents a record in the database for every data object. |
| **Base Entity** This module acts as a common base class for several data objects which can be inherited to reuse common attributes of the data. |
| **Course** Represents a course entity. This module acts as a data object and has course specific attributes used to create new entries for courses in the database. |
| **Course Student** This package is a data object which has “Student Course” specific attributes i.e. the courses enrolled by the students. It is used to create new entries for student courses in the database. |
| **Feedback Question** This module represents the data structure for feedback question. It is used to create new entries for feedback questions in the database. |
| **Feedback Response** This module defines the structure for feedback response data object. It is used to create new entries for feedback responses in the database. |
| **Feedback Response Comment** This module represents the data object specific to the feedback response specifications. It creates new entries for comments on feedback response in the database and can be generated by student or instructor. It can be represented as: generator -&gt; \[comments about\] -&gt; feedback response |
| **Student Profile** This module represents profile details for the student entities associated with an Account entity. It is used to create new entries for student profiles in the database. |
| **Instructor** The instructor module represents the instructor for the specific course. It defines the data structure for storage of instructor data object and is used to create new entries for assignment of instructor to a particular course. |
| **Feedback Session** This module represents an instructor created feedback session. It maps the data structure used to represent feedback session in the database and is used to create new database entries for the same. |
| **API** This package provides an internal api for the application to communicate with the datastore. It provides functionalities for performing database operations like CRUD \(Create, Read, Update, Delete\). |
| **Entities DB** This module acts as a base class for all classes performing CRUD operations against the datastore. |
| Feedback DB Handles the CRUD operations for all the feedback related operations like feedback session, feedback question, feedback response and feedback response comments. |
| **Students DB**, **Profiles DB**, **AccountsDB**, **CoursesDB**, **InstructorsDB** These modules handle the CRUD operations for students, profiles, accounts, courses and instructor database. |
| **Ofyhelper** This module initializes the Objectify service at the startup of the application and register entity classes in the objectify service. Objectify is the main underlying interface used to communicate with the Google Cloud Datastore. |
| **Search** This package defines the logic for the document storage for indexing and/or searching the records in the database. |
| **Search Document** This module defines how we store the document for indexing and searching. |
| **Search Manager** This module manages the documents and indexes in the datastore for the use of search functions. |
| **Search Query** This module defines the structure and method used by the application to query the database. |
| **Student Search Query** This module represents a data structure that define how we query for students in the database. |
| **Student Search Document** This module defines the structure to represent how the students are stored in the database. |
| **Instructor Search Document** This module defines the structure to represent how the instructors are stored in the database. |
| **Feedback Response Comment Search Query** This module defines a data structure that defines how we query for feedback response comments. |
| **Instructor Search Query** This module defines a data structure that defines how we query for instructors. |
| **Objectify** Objectify is a Java data access API for Google Cloud Datastore which is used as an interface between the application storage logic and the underlying datastore. |
| **Google App Engine** Google App Engine \(GAE\) is a platform as a service offering on the Google Cloud Platform which has internal libraries like Objectify to establish connection and perform database transactions with Google Cloud Datastore. |
| **Google Cloud Datastore** Google Cloud Datastore is a fully managed database service offered by Google which is an underlying database technology for Teammates. |
