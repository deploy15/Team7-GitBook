# About teammates system

Teammates strives to provide anonymous peer evaluation and feedback, while also allowing an instructor to share their own comments. Ethics and privacy are an important aspect for any software may it be open source or licensed. “Teammates” is hosted on Google App Engine and thereby uses the Google servers for storing and managing the data. This means that Teammates uses the same security mechanisms that Google uses to protect the data. The communication between the software components is performed using the inbound bandwidth within the Google Cloud Servers and thereby the data transfer between different software components is securely transported. Understanding the current goals of Teammates, it is clear that the consumer data hosted within the application is not being used for research purposes, none of the developers have access to the consumer data in production. Only the system administrators have access to consumer data for troubleshooting and performance monitoring purposes.
